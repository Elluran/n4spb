# Facade integrity: no see-through walls, no crossing labels (city module)

User reports 2026-10-06: "buildings with transparent parts" (poses `-363.5,1.5,579.8,-2.4,-5.5`, `-323.6,1.5,-44.7,125.1,-1.5`) and "labels on buildings crossed by each other, z-fights"
(`-328.9,1.5,553.7,20.3,9.6`, `-300,1.5,-33.2,-268,2.1`). Two root causes, found with two headless audits, fixed in the generator (`src/world/city/**`), not per building.
Read this before you touch `city/edges.js`, `walls.js`, `passages.js`, `shops.js`, `entrances.js`, `clutter.js` or add anything that hangs on a facade.

## 1. Root causes and the rules they gave

### A. Walls hid each other and left slits onto the hollow body

The city draws every house as a HOLLOW shell of one-sided wall quads (back faces are culled). A wall that is not drawn is a window onto the sky and onto the inside of the neighbours.

1. **Cracks between neighbours (the big one).** OSM nodes of a shared wall are rounded to ~0.1 m, so two houses that share a wall end up 2-12 cm apart. `edges.js` probed 12 cm in front of every wall, found the neighbour
   and hid BOTH walls (and the lower neighbour drew only above its own cornice): a slit 5-10 cm wide over the full height of the party wall, open to the sky at the street end (pose 2: the whole slit between two houses showed
   the courtyard behind). 254 000 audit samples (~26 km of wall) were affected. **Rule: a wall may only be hidden where the neighbour really touches it** (1.2 cm probe). Where the neighbour is within 12 cm but not touching,
   the part that stays hidden gets a plain blank LINER quad (`edge.liners`, `walls.js addLiners`: no wall record, no details, no collider, ~15 000 triangles in total).
2. **Sampling every 0.9 m lost the ends of party walls.** Runs shorter than 0.45 m were dropped, boundaries were only known to 0.9 m: slivers 0.2-0.9 m wide beside every party wall end showed through
   (the 30 cm slit in pose 2). **Rule: wall pieces come from EXACT intervals** (the probe lines cross the neighbours' footprint boundaries at computed parameters, every elementary interval is classified once), every visible
   interval down to 5 cm becomes a quad, and a facade piece narrower than a bay (0.9 m) is a plain blank wall (`walls.js blankQuad`, same for the remainder beside a carriage arch).
3. **Arches cut into raised parts.** A room over a passage (OSM part with `min_level`) got a carriage-arch gate cut into its wall; the arch spring line (2.55 m + radius) is above the part's top: the face collapsed to
   nothing (a hole over the passage, Bankovsky pereulok). **Rule: gates only on ground records** (`passages.js planPassages` skips `minH > 0.5`).
4. **Roofless twins.** `city.js dupSkip` removed the deck of the later twin of every same-footprint pair, but `prep.js` had already dropped the OTHER twin (`dupOf`): both lost the deck (w1185754667, w535381121).
   **Rule: a record only loses its deck when its twin is drawn by this module.**
5. Hand-built towers (`towers.js`, the City Duma tower) are occluders for their neighbours: their footprint edges count as faces in the audit (reason `custom-tower`).

### B. Facade labels crossed each other: a coordinate bug, not a z-fight

`walls.js addSubWall` writes `units[].s`, `units[].door`, `doors[].s` **local to `w.a`** (`w.a` already includes `w.s0`; `city-facade-test.mjs` asserts it). Checkpoint 44 changed `shops.js`, `entrances.js`
and `erkers.js` to `x = w.a + dir * (u.s - w.s0)`, i.e. it subtracted `s0` a SECOND time: every sub-wall that does not start at the start of its edge (walls longer than 30 m, party-wall pieces, the part beyond an arch -
a large share of all shop walls) got its shop signs, awnings, shop entrances, door steps and canopies shifted `s0` metres BACK, on top of the first sub-wall's: 6015 pairs of shop signs overlapped (35 % of all signs), most of the
rest hung over neighbours or the street. **Rule: `u.s`, `u.door`, `d.s`, `w.bal` bays are local to `w.a`; never subtract `w.s0`.** `tools/city-label-audit.mjs` measures "floating signs" (> 40 cm from the footprint edge of their own
building) and fails on them.

Facade slot allocation (new, `city/slots.js`, shared registry `ctx.services.labels`, `docs/rules/LABELS-API.md`):

| order | who | kind | rectangle (wall plane) | standoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `streets/plates.js` (built before the city) | `plate`, `number` | their own | 3 cm |
| 2 | `shops.js` fascia sign | `shop` | W (6.2 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2.2 / 1.8 / 1.4) x 0.62 at `yBand - 0.57`, W <= unit width - 0.15 | 3.5 cm |
| 3 | `shops.js` awning | `awning` | unit width, 1 m tall below the fascia; starts `proj + 0.1` m away from a wall CORNER (QUOIN flag), skipped when a wall stands < 1 m in front (slit between houses) | 3D box |
| 4 | `shops.js` address plate | `plate-city` | 0.62 x 0.32; skipped when streets already hung a `number` plate for the building | 4 cm |
| 5 | `entrances.js` canopy, steps | `canopy`, `steps` | 2.1 m; a door nearer than 1.2 m to a wall end / 2.7 m to a corner gets none; no two sets of steps within 2.4 m (any orientation) | - |
| 6 | `entrances.js` downpipes | `pipe` | 0.17 x height; nearest of (ideal, -1, +1) bay boundary that is free, else none | 12 cm |
| 7 | `clutter.js` AC units | `ac` | 0.74 x 0.46, >= 0.6 m from a wall end | 6 cm |

Rules: reserve BEFORE you draw, skip (or shift) when `reserve()` says no; two labels never overlap, so the standoff only matters against the painted wall shader (flat at 0); keep every standoff >= 1.5 cm and the
sign material's polygonOffset. A later module (props ads, clocks) asks the same registry. Never draw two things on one wall rectangle, never anchor a detail by a wall-relative number you did not check in `city-facade-test.mjs`.

## 2. Audits (headless, no GPU, seconds)

```
node tools/city-wall-audit.mjs                     # every wall edge has a face or an allow-listed reason; roofs, floors, winding.  --owned all|none  --near x,z,r  --json file  --list N
node tools/city-label-audit.mjs                    # shop signs / plates / awnings / steps / pipes / AC: pairwise overlap + floating items.  --near x,z,r  --list N  --max N
node tools/city-facade-test.mjs                    # unit / door offsets are local to the sub-wall
node tools/party-wall-test.mjs                     # indexed party-wall lookups of the landmark modules
node tools/check.mjs city                          # triangles (budget warning is old: 2.5 M), build time
node tools/zfight.mjs --only environment,streets,city --cams "x,z,yaw,pitch;..." --t 10 --quiet --out shots/<you>/z     # pixels
```

**Always pass `--only ...` to `zfight.mjs` / `qa-pick.mjs`** (or `--params baked=0`): without it they load `assets/baked/city-base` when its revision matches and you measure the BAKED (old) city, not your source.
Re-bake (`npm run bake`) after any `src/` edit, then re-run the pixel probe on the baked scene once.

Wall audit method (`city-wall-audit.mjs`): runs the city pipeline (prepare, describe, analyse, planPassages, buildWalls with a RECORDING builder) and, for every ring edge of every drawn record, samples every 0.3 m at three heights;
a point 2 cm outside the wall that is not inside another mass (drawn record, landmark-owned occluder, custom tower) is exposed and must have a face that `buildWalls` really emitted (same facing, 6 cm in front .. 30 cm behind the wall
line, covering that height). Allow-list (the only legitimate reasons; everything else exits 1): `arch-opening`, `embedded-sliver` (corner slivers <= 3 m of a wall hidden by an embedded neighbour), `below-raised`
(room over a passage / ground body), `low-steps` (records < 0.6 m), `custom-tower`, `landmark-owned`.

Numbers (whole map, 6003 records, 61 537 edges, 9.0 M samples): unexplained gap runs **10 751 -> 0** (254 017 -> 52 gap samples, the rest allow-listed slivers), roofless records 2 -> 0, raised parts without a body 23 (all over passages,
allowed). Label audit (play area + 50 m, 6199 buildings, 91 480 items): overlapping shop signs **6015 -> 0**, colliding items of all kinds 6015+ -> 2 (oblique-corner canopy / awning pairs, allow-listed by `--max 3`), floating signs 0.
Pixel probe, Nevsky sweep of 36 frames (procedural city): 427 noisy pixels in total, worst frame 0.005 %.

### C. Street wall or courtyard wall?
`edges.js` marks an edge as a street wall when a drivable road is within 11 m, or when it faces open public ground: AREAS polygons with `hw` square / pedestrian (2.5 m or 5 m in front of the wall). Before this, walls facing Konyushennaya Square (stables block, ~(-1400,-1024)) were courtyard walls (khaki courtyard colour, no shop fronts). Parking lots and service areas stay courtyards. `edge.street.square = true`, `road = null` for these.

### D. Landmark houses (`landmarks*/house.js sharedWall`)
The landmark kit hid a whole facade edge when 2 of 3 sample points were within 0.7 m of an antiparallel edge of any other building (and `partyOpts.tol` raised it to 0.6-0.7 m): cracks and partly shared walls left holes (the Beloselsky palace corner beside Nevsky 41, pose `-323.6,1.5,-44.7,125.1,-1.5`). Now all kit copies (B, C, D, E, G, J, K, Mars) use the CONTACT rule: an edge is a party wall only when ALL 9 sample points along it touch (1.2 cm) an antiparallel edge of a building at least as tall (`e.hc`); `o.tol` is ignored. Anything else is drawn (the wall inside a neighbour is never seen). `tools/party-wall-test.mjs` checks the indexed lookups against a full scan of this rule, including synthetic exact party walls, 5 cm cracks and lower neighbours. Modules without `house.js` (F, H, I, Castle, Garden, Tauride ...) draw every edge and need nothing.

### E. Claims
`city-wall-audit.mjs` also fails when a drawn city record is claimed by an owned landmark group (id or parent) or stands inside the footprint of an owned building (a part / raised part / synthesised `~f` base of a claimed house would keep drawing deck, railings and walls in the air). Today: 0. Remember that walls are one-sided: standing INSIDE a footprint (a teleport pose such as `-3382,1.7,128`, inside `w97546619`) shows only decks, balconies and railings, as if hung in the air.

## 3. Checklist for a new generator that draws walls or facade details

1. Walls: never hide a wall because a neighbour is NEAR; hide only on contact (1.2 cm), keep a liner for the near-but-not-touching part. Keep every visible interval >= 5 cm. Raised parts get no arch.
2. Anything that is cut out of or added to a wall is positioned in `w.a`-local metres. Run `city-facade-test.mjs`.
3. Reserve your rectangle in `ctx.services.labels` (or `city/slots.js labelRegistry(ctx)` in the city) before drawing.
4. Run both city audits and the pixel probe (`--only`) before you report. A new district: nothing to add, the audits walk the whole data.
5. A landmark module that draws its own walls next to generic houses: use the same contact rule for its `sharedWall` (`landmarksD/kit.js ringEdges` lookups) - the crack class applies there too (not audited here).
